<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Pomodoro is a technique for studying (or just concentrate/focus) on a task. The idea is to divide some large windows to focus and intercalate them with small windows to relax and, after 3 cycles of windows, take a large relax window.</p>
<p>Since this a simple project (just to train some fundamentals) i'm just using base technologies as HTML, CSS and JS (without any major framework).</p>
